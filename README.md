# Introduction
The size of this T-MINI-PLUS lidar is 3.39cm*3.86cm, can be easily installed on some compact devices. It adopts the TOF ranging principle, scanning radius up to 12M, can effectively perceive distant environmental information in 360Â°. Since it can resist 60kLux light, it is suitable for most indoor and outdoor environments. Based on the ROS robot, we provide ROS1, ROS2 driver code, debugging software and related usage tutorials for user reference. In addition to the separate lidar module, Yahboom also provide connecting cables and serial port adapter boards to facilitate user debugging.
# Features
